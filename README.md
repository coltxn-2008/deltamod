## Why Deltamod Community?

Deltamod Community keeps each mod setup organized and gives you a safer path back when an installation goes wrong.

- **Find mods in one place.** Browse compatible content from GameBanana, ModDB, and Nexus Mods, or import a local archive.
- **Keep setups separate.** Use installations, profiles, and collections instead of repeatedly moving game files by hand.
- **Patch with recovery in mind.** Supported operations use staging, verification, and rollback paths before publishing changes to a game installation.
- **Understand what is installed.** Inspect mod health, versions, files, conflicts, and operation history from the Installed Mods view.
- **Use the platform you already have.** Native packages are available for Windows, Linux, Intel Mac, and Apple Silicon Mac.

You do **not** need Node.js, Rust, Git, or other development tools to use the app.

## Download

The current build is the **2.0.18 unsigned Tauri release**. Open the release page, expand **Assets**, and download one installer from this table:

| Your computer | Download this file |
| --- | --- |
| Windows PC with a 64-bit Intel or AMD processor | `Deltamod-Community_2.0.18_x86_64-pc-windows-msvc-setup.exe` |
| Mac with an Apple chip (M1 or newer) | `Deltamod.Community_2.0.18_aarch64.dmg` |
| Mac with an Intel processor | `Deltamod.Community_2.0.18_x64.dmg` |
| Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, or another Debian-based x64 distribution | `Deltamod.Community_2.0.18_amd64.deb` |

  </a>
</p>

> [!TIP]
> Most players need only one `.exe`, `.dmg`, or `.deb`. The `.json` evidence files, signatures, checksums, tool source archives, and GitHub-generated source archives are not installers.

> [!WARNING]
> Windows and macOS packages are not currently code-signed, and the macOS packages are not notarized. Your operating system may show an unknown-publisher warning. Download only from this repository, verify the attached `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and install manually when a newer release is published.

<details>
<summary><strong>Installation and checksum help</strong></summary>

### Windows

1. Download the Windows setup `.exe`.
2. Compare its SHA-256 hash with the matching entry in `SHA256SUMS.txt`.
3. Run the installer and open **Deltamod Community**.

Windows SmartScreen may show **Windows protected your PC** because the installer is unsigned. After verifying the download, choose **More info → Run anyway** if you decide to proceed.

### macOS

1. Check **Apple menu → About This Mac** to see whether your Mac uses an Apple chip or Intel processor.
2. Download the matching DMG and verify it against `SHA256SUMS.txt`.
3. Open the DMG and move **Deltamod Community** to Applications.

If Gatekeeper blocks the app after verification, try opening it once, then use **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway**.

### Linux

Install the Debian package with your graphical package manager or run this command from the download directory:

```console
sudo apt install ./Deltamod.Community_2.0.18_amd64.deb
```

### Verify a checksum

| System | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Windows PowerShell | `Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 -LiteralPath '.\Deltamod-Community_2.0.18_x86_64-pc-windows-msvc-setup.exe'` |
| macOS Apple Silicon | `shasum -a 256 Deltamod.Community_2.0.18_aarch64.dmg` |
| macOS Intel | `shasum -a 256 Deltamod.Community_2.0.18_x64.dmg` |
| Linux x64 | `sha256sum Deltamod.Community_2.0.18_amd64.deb` |

Delete the installer and download it again if the hashes do not match exactly.

## Get started

1. Open Deltamod Community and add your game installation.
2. Browse the Mod Shop or import a compatible mod archive.
3. Install the mod and choose the profile or collection where it belongs.
4. Review compatibility or conflict information, then patch and launch the game.
5. Keep separate profiles for mods or game versions that should not be combined.

Always check the mod author's compatibility notes. A supported game does not mean every mod supports every version of that game.

## Supported games and platforms

| Game | Support |
| --- | :---: |
| DELTARUNE | ✅ |
| DELTARUNE Demo | ✅ |
| DELTARUNE Demo (LTS) | ✅ |
| UNDERTALE | ✅ |
| Undertale Yellow | ✅ |
| Pizza Tower | ✅ |

| Platform | Status | Notes |
| --- | :---: | --- |
| Windows x64 | **Stable** | Recommended platform |
| Linux x64 | **Experimental** | Official package targets Debian-based distributions |
| macOS Apple Silicon | **Experimental** | Native app; xdelta/G3M patches need Windows reference files; `.csx` patches are unavailable |
| macOS Intel | **Experimental** | Native app; xdelta/G3M patches need Windows reference files |
| Wine / CrossOver | **Unofficial** | May work, but is not a release target |

UndertaleModTool `.csx` patches are supported on Windows x64, Linux x64, and Intel Macs. The required upstream CLI is not currently available for Apple Silicon.

### Patching on macOS

- **Managed copy.** When you add DELTARUNE on a Mac, Deltamod copies only `DELTARUNE.app` into its own data folder and patches that copy. The game in `/Applications` is never changed. Deltamod refuses to patch an installation that points at it, and the Install Manager marks such installations so you can add the game again as a copy.
- **Windows reference files.** Most DELTARUNE mods are xdelta patches made against the Windows `data.win`. The Mac `game.ios` files are packed differently, so those patches do not apply to them directly. Under **Options → Installation → Windows reference files**, choose a Windows copy of the same game version once. Deltamod applies mods to those `data.win` files with G3MTool and installs the result in the copy as `game.ios`. Mods that only replace files, such as music, do not need them.
- **Game-version checks.** For a mod's reference-backed patch targets, required-file checks use the Windows reference copy. Other required files are checked in the managed game copy. A missing, unsafe, or mismatching reference file still blocks the mod when hash checks are enabled.
- **Re-signing.** Changing files inside an app bundle breaks its signature, so Deltamod clears the quarantine flag on the copy and ad-hoc re-signs it with `codesign` after every patch and restore. If re-signing fails, the patch screen shows a warning.
- **Recovery after older builds.** Older builds without the stable volume identity could record a copy's recovery history under a key that changed after a reboot. Deltamod continues under the stable key only when the older history ended on the original files before the newer history began. Otherwise it refuses to patch rather than risk treating modded files as the original.
- **Saves are shared.** The copy and the original game both use `~/Library/Application Support/com.tobyfox.deltarune`. Back up your saves before trying new mods.

Options → Mac explains the same steps inside the app.

## Mod sources

| Source | How it works |
| --- | --- |
| **GameBanana** | Browse supported catalogue entries inside Deltamod |
| **ModDB** | Browse listings and open compatible downloads |
| **Nexus Mods** | Sign in from **Options → Nexus Mods** to browse Nexus content |
| **Local archive** | Import a compatible archive you already downloaded |

Nexus Premium members can download compatible archives through the API. Nexus may require non-Premium members to confirm a download on its website and then import the downloaded archive. GameBanana, ModDB, and local imports do not require a Nexus account.

## Play safely

- Back up important saves and game files before experimenting.
- Use mods from authors and sources you trust.
- Check that each mod supports your exact game version.
- Avoid combining mods unless their authors say they are compatible.
- Treat `.csx` patches as executable scripts and review their source or trustworthiness before running them.

Deltamod adds validation, staging, and recovery around supported operations, but these safeguards do not replace your own backup.

<details>
<summary><strong>Developer setup</strong></summary>

Development is Tauri-only and requires Node.js 22, Rust, and the platform prerequisites for [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/). `npm run dev` stages the native workers and verified tools before starting Tauri. There is no Electron fallback.

```console
git clone https://github.com/cmdr-chara/deltamod.git
cd deltamod
npm ci
npm run acquire:g3mtool
# Windows, Linux and Intel macOS only:
npm run acquire:undertale-mod-tool
npm run dev
```

On Apple Silicon, skip the UndertaleModTool acquisition command. CSX is explicitly
unavailable there; G3MTool remains supported. Tool downloads are pinned and verified,
not installed by `npm ci`.

`npm run build:tauri` creates NSIS on Windows, a `.deb` on Linux, and app/DMG bundles
on macOS. To select another supported architecture on the same operating system,
set `TAURI_BUILD_TARGET` before the **whole** npm command so tool/worker staging and
the Tauri CLI agree. Install that Rust target first. Do not pass `--target` after
`npm run build:tauri`; the wrapper rejects it rather than package mismatched sidecars.
Use `npm run build:tauri:no-bundle` to compile without an installer.

Common checks:

```console
npm test
npm run typecheck
npm run security:audit
```

### Nexus integration contract

Deltamod uses **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code with PKCE S256** for Nexus Mods sign-in. The registered loopback callback is fixed at `http://127.0.0.1:52817/callback`; the client **never falls back to a dynamic port**.

Nexus catalogue browsing uses a **bounded result page** of 50 items and fetches only the requested page. Quota handling honors `Retry-After` and quota reset metadata so requests can pause and retry instead of repeatedly hitting the API while limited.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) for native checks and [RELEASE-GATE.md](./docs/RELEASE-GATE.md) for release requirements.
